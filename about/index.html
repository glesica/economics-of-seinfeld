<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>
<p>This site is part of an ongoing and expanding attempt to make these sorts of popular culture teaching materials widely and conveniently available. We are doing this in the hopes that the materials hosted here, now and in the future, will be useful to economics educators.</p>
<p>The clips have been posted through &lt;CriticalCommons.org&gt;, a “non-profit advocacy coalition that supports the use of media for scholarship, reasearch and teaching, providing resources, information and tools for scholars, students, educators and creators.” We are thankful for their service.</p>
<p>Please feel free to email the authors to provide general comments about the site or make suggestions of other clips.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-site">Using the Site</h3>
<p>A list of all economic concepts is provided on the index page. For ease, you may also search by concept or episode title. If you click on a concept, you will be provided a list of episodes that demonstrate that concept. We have also proved simple definitions and explanations of economic concepts and jargon.</p>
<p>Under each of the clips, you will be able to find information on the season, disc, and the approximate times for each clip on the Seinfeld series DVD. A video clip (of these specific scenes) has been compiled and is provided for use in the classroom. You can also provide feedback directly on the site about the usefulness of each clip. There is no need to log in if you do not wish to.</p>
