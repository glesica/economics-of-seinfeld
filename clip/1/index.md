## The Pilot

Girl calls Jerry and tells him, “I have to be in town for a conference, but I can't find a decent hotel room in Manhattan.”  George and Kramer say that these are signals.  The girl arrives, and sends many additional signals (at least Jerry thinks she does), but ultimately tells Jerry that she's engaged.  What Jerry needs is a screening device.
