## The Stakeout

Jerry accompanies Elaine to a piano bar. He meets a girl he likes at the dinnertable, as a piano plays in the background.  She asks, "How much do you suppose it'd take to get him to stop?" Jerry says, "I'm in for $5." She replies, "I'll supply the hat." This is a private solution to the externality.
