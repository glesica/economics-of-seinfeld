## The Pez Dispenser

George is dating a pianist.  He needs “hand,” as she is clearly the alpha member of the pair.  Kramer suggests a preemptive breakup.  George analyzes—if she accepts the breakup, there's no loss, as she was going to break up with him anyway.  If she rejects the breakup, he will have established himself as the alpha member.  Therefore, the preemptive breakup is a dominant strategy.  It works; he gets a high payoff.
