## The Cheever Letters

Kramer receives a bunch of cuban cigars from George;  he trades them to a golf pro for access to a very nice course.  When the cigars are lost in a fire, Kramer goes to the Cuban embassy, where he finds that they are illegal.  But the Cuban diplomats are willing to trade some cigars for Kramer's favorite jacket...and for access to the nice golf course.
