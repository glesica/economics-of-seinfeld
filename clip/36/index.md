## The Smelly Car

While Jerry and Elaine are at a restaurant, a valet parking attendant with body odor leaves Jerry's car with a lingering smell.  The external costs are large: the smell attaches itself to Jerry and Elaine, who have to resort to costly measures to cleanse themselves.  Jerry attempts to recoup some of the damage by cleverly bargaining with the restaurant owner to cover the cost of cleaning the car.  In the end, the cleaning is not enough, and Jerry leaves the car and keys in plain sight hoping it will be stolen, in which case the insurance company will bear the loss.
