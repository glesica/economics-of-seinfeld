## The Parking Space

George won't pay for a parking spot in a garage because he would rather find a public spot (nonexcludable) for free.  George backs into a spot while another guy comes in headfirst, resulting in the question, “Who is entitled to the space?”  Insecure property rights have led to overuse and conflict.  George says, “I was here first.”   The parking jam-up ruins street access for everyone else; everyone ends up fighting about property rights, even the police, who can't decide.
