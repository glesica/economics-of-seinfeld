## The Barber

George thinks he has been offered a job, but the man offering it to him got interrupted in the middle of the offer, and will be on vacation for the next week.  George, unsure whether an offer has actually been extended, decides that his best strategy is to show up.  If the job was indeed his, this is the right move.  But even if the job is not, he believes that the benefits outweigh the costs.
