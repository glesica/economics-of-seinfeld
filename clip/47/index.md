## The Stall

Elaine is in the bathroom, and finds her stall out of toilet paper.  She asks the woman in the next stall if she can spare a square, but the woman says no.  The woman turns out to be Jerry's date, and eventually he defends her by likening the scarce toilet paper to water in the desert:  “You wouldn't ask a dying man in the desert for his canteen, would you?”
