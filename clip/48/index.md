## The Marine Biologist

Jerry is showing Elaine a T-shirt he's had for six years that he calls “Golden Boy.”  It's his go-to shirt, it's always first out of the dryer, and it he wears it for playing every game.  Yet Golden Boy is wearing out and fraying at the collar.  Elaine responds that she has to go meet a famous author, and Jerry replies “You want to wear Golden Boy?” (making the t-shirt look more like a tool than a consumer good).  At the end of the show, Golden Boy is gone, having died in the dryer.  But Jerry replaced his capital with a new shirt, “Baby Blue.”
