## The Marine Biologist

Kramer gives Elaine an organizer that he got at the bank when he opened a new account;  Jerry proudly shows off a tape recorder that he got at a different bank.  In the days before bank deregulation, interest rates were administered:  0% on checking accounts, 5.25% on savings accounts.  With market interest rates higher than these, there was no way for banks to compete for funds except to offer additional perks like toasters, tape recorders, and organizers.
