## The Marine Biologist

Kramer gives Elaine a new electronic organizer, which through a series of unfortunate events, gets lost.  She goes to Kramer bemoaning the fact that she had put everything in the organizer, and had thrown away her paper organizer.  If she hadn't put all of her eggs in one basket (her events in one organizer), she could have reduced her exposure to risk.
