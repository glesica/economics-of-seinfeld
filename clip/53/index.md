## The Hamptons

Kramer, at the beach in the Hamptons with friends, finds a rope dangling into the water and pulls up a pot full of lobsters.  He serves them for dinner that night, and his host says that he's poached them from a commercial lobsterman.  Kramer says, “What's the problem? There's plenty for everyone.”  This highlights the wedge between individual incentives and optimal social outcomes.
