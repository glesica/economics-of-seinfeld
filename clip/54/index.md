## The Opposite

Elaine is to meet her boyfriend at the theater.  She gets a message at the ticket booth that he's been in an accident.  Before leaving to see him at the hospital, she stops for popcorn and Jujubes, reasoning that she can't change the past so she might as well maximize at the margin.
