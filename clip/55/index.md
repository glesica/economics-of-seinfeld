## The Chaperone

Jerry is dating a Miss America contestant, and Kramer appoints himself her chaperone.  While at dinner, Kramer asks what she would do to make the world a better place.  She says that she would try to end world hunger.  “If everyone ate one meal less, there would be enough food to feed the world.”  Jerry says that's one “helluva plan.”  This is an example of unsound economic reasoning:  the misconception that for others to have more, we must take less.
