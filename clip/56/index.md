## The Pledge Drive

Jerry is hosting a pledge drive for a local PBS station.  His grandmother calls in to talk to him about some checks she's written him that bounced.  Kramer receives her call, and asks, "You listen to the station, don't you?  Don't be a freeloader!”  He then announces that Jerry's grandmother, who is on a fixed income, has donated $1500 to the station.  Broadcast television is a pure public good—nonrival, nonexcludable, and with no commercials to fund its programs, relies on voluntary contributions to survive.  No wonder it's always on the verge of collapse!
