## The Kiss Hello

Fifty-three years ago, Jerry's Uncle Leo stiffed Jerry's mother out of $50.  Eager to get it back, Jerry's father says, “Do you know what that's worth today in interest alone? $663.45, figured at a conservative 5% interest, compounded quarterly.”  Morty's calculations are almost accurate, though he does not compound quarterly, and his sum includes the principle, not just the interest.
