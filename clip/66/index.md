## The Maestro

Kramer has sneaked coffee into a theater, where he spills it on himself.  While consulting with his lawyer, Jackie Chiles, they discuss the theater's monopoly on concessions. (This is a great place to discuss David Friedman's and Steven Landsburg's take on why movie theater popcorn is so expensive.)
