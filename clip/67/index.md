## The Soup Nazi

The Soup Nazi makes delicious soupâ€”so good there's always a line outside his shop.  He refuses service to Elaine, and by a stroke of luck she comes across his stash of soup recipes.  She visits his shop and informs him that his soup monopoly is broken, while waving his recipes in his face.  Also in this clip, George gets charged $2 for a roll that everyone else gets for free.  This example of price discrimination shows that in order to charge different customers different prices, you must have market power.
