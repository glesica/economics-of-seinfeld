## The Invitations

George is anxious to get out of his impending marriage to Susan.  Kramer suggests that he ask for a prenuptial agreement, knowing it will signal Susan that George isn't committed to the idea of marriage and pushing her to back out.  But in order for George's action to be credible, going without a prenup must cost him something.  Susan knows this and willingly signs, saying, “Prenup?  I make more money than you do!  Sure, I'll sign!”
