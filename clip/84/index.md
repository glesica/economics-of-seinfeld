## The Chicken Roaster

A Kenny Rogers Roaster restaurant opens across the street from Kramer.  He can't stand the red glare from Kenny's neon sign, and moves into Jerry's apartment.  But he becomes hooked on Kenny's chicken, and eventually accepts the red glare in exchange for access to the chicken.  When Kenny's shuts down, the lights go out, and Kramer's overall welfare fallsâ€”the benefits of the chicken outweighed the cost of the glare.
