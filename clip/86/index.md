## The Muffin Tops

Elaine and her old boss find that selling just the tops of muffins is more profitable than selling the whole muffin (which consists of the top + the stump).  So are the top and the stump complements or substitutes?  Neither--the stumps are an economic bad, which reduce utility.  Evidence for this is found in the fact that homeless people won't eat the stumps that the muffin-top restaurant throws away, unless they come with the tops as compensation.
