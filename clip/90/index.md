## The Finale

Kramer, George, Jerry, and Elaine sit by and watch while a man is carjacked.  They are arrested for not acting under the town's new Good Samaritan law.  The law is designed to overcome individuals' incentive not to come to others' rescue;  we can think of this as a law that changes payoffs in a game matrix.
