## The Pez Dispenser/The Pick (Part I)

Kramer invents "The Beach" cologne.  Jerry tells him to run it by a guy in marketing at Calvin Klein, and Kramer does. The guy scoffs at the idea, but CK begins producing a cologne called "The Ocean." Without a patent, Kramer is powerless to seek recourse, but the folks at CK offer him a modeling contract, essentially in exchange for his silence. (This story line crosses two episodes. The Season, Disc, and Time information below is for "The Pez Dispenser" section. See Part II for the Season, Disc and Time information for "The Pick.") THE VIDEO CLIP CONTAINS BOTH PARTS.
