## The Pez Dispenser/The Pick (Part II)

Kramer invents "The Beach" cologne.  Jerry tells him to run it by a guy in marketing at Calvin Klein, and Kramer does. The guy scoffs at the idea, but CK begins producing a cologne called "The Ocean." Without a patent, Kramer is powerless to seek recourse, but the folks at CK offer him a modeling contract, essentially in exchange for his silence. (This story line crosses two episodes. The Season, Disc, and Time information below is for "The Pick" section. See Part I for the Season, Disc and Time information for "The Pez Dispenser.") THE VIDEO CLIP CONTAINS BOTH PARTS.
