## The Trip (Part I)

In Part I, George asks Lupe, the maid at his hotel, to untuck the sheets at the foot of his bed, because he can't sleep if the sheets are too tight.   In Part II:  George is disappointed in Lupe, who didn't untuck his sheets as she had promised.  Jerry asks George if he remembered to tip Lupe, but George forgot (no incentive after you're gone and if you're not coming back).  Jerry says, “That's why communism failed.” (This story line crosses two episodes. The Season, Disc, and Time information below is for "Part I." See "Part II" for the Season, Disc and Time information for the other half.) THE VIDEO CLIP CONTAINS BOTH PARTS.
