## The Parking Garage

Kramer has forgotten where he parked his car in a multi-level parking garage of a shopping mall and the gang walk around for an eternity looking for the car. Jerry needs to urinate and Kramer encourages him to do so in a dark corner where no one can see him. While doing so, he is spotted by an officer, and held in the officer's booth. Later in the episode, George is caught doing the same thing.
