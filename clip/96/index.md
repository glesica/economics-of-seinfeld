## The Junior Mint

Kramer & Jerry go to visit Elaine's ex-boyfriend, who is in hospital undergoing surgery. While at the hospital, Kramer persuades Jerry to watch the operation with him in a gallery above the operating theatre. When Kramer sneaks in candy and forces it on Jerry, Jerry knocks his hand and a Junior Mint falls from the gallery and lands inside the patient! Jerry thinks he may have killed the guy but he makes a miraculous recovery!
