## The Mango

George tells Jerry about his problems below the "equator", i.e. in bed with his latest girlfriend, Karen, and is concerned that she is faking orgasms. When Elaine enters the conversation, they discuss the issue of "faking" and Elaine confesses that she used to fake orgasms with Jerry when they were dating. Jerry is horrified, as he thought the orgasms were real.
