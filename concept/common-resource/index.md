## Concept: common resource

A common resource is a type of good consisting of a natural or human-made resource system, whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use. Unlike pure public goods, common resources face problems of congestion or overuse, because they are rival. Examples of common resources include irrigation systems, fishing grounds, pastures, forests, water or the atmosphere.
