## Concept: signaling

Signaling is the idea that one party (termed the “agent”) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the “principal”). For example, in job-market signaling, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring certain education credentials. The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer assumes it is positively correlated with having greater ability.
