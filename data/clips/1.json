Game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well."}, {"id": "892", "object_id": "1", "content_type_id": "18", "tag_id": "10", "name": "signaling", "slug": "signaling", "description": "Signaling is the idea that one party (termed the \u201cagent\u201d) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the \u201cprincipal\u201d).
