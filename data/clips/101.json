Game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well."}, {"id": "928", "object_id": "101", "content_type_id": "18", "tag_id": "98", "name": "randomized strategies", "slug": "randomized-strategies", "description": "A randomized strategy introduces a chance element into the decision-making process that is designed to confound the information content of the decision-maker's observed choices."}], "segments": [], "source": {"id": "1", "title": "Seinfeld", "slug": "seinfeld", "description": "Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a \u201cshow about nothing.\u201d Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances.
