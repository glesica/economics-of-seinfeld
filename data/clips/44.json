Microeconomics theory distinguishes between perfect competition and imperfect competition, concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than perfect competition. Competition, according to economic theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition (monopoly) or little competition (oligopoly)."}], "segments": [{"id": "806", "clip_id": "44", "clipsegment_id": "67", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "2", "start_seconds": "13", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "5", "end_seconds": "6"}, {"id": "807", "clip_id": "44", "clipsegment_id": "68", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "8", "start_seconds": "23", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "9", "end_seconds": "25"}, {"id": "808", "clip_id": "44", "clipsegment_id": "69", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "10", "start_seconds": "14", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "12", "end_seconds": "6"}, {"id": "809", "clip_id": "44", "clipsegment_id": "70", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "19", "start_seconds": "20", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "20", "end_seconds": "3"}], "source": {"id": "1", "title": "Seinfeld", "slug": "seinfeld", "description": "Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a \u201cshow about nothing.\u201d Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances.
