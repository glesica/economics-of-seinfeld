The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well."}], "segments": [{"id": "804", "clip_id": "45", "clipsegment_id": "72", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "5", "start_seconds": "6", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "5", "end_seconds": "57"}, {"id": "805", "clip_id": "45", "clipsegment_id": "71", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "0", "start_seconds": "40", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "2", "end_seconds": "14"}], "source": {"id": "1", "title": "Seinfeld", "slug": "seinfeld", "description": "Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a \u201cshow about nothing.\u201d Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances. It is the simplicity of Seinfeld that makes it so appropriate for use in economics courses.
