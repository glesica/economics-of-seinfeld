Because the total quantity of goods and services that people would like to have always far exceeds the amount which available economic resources are capable of producing in all known human societies, people must constantly make choices about which desires to satisfy first and which to leave less than fully satisfied for the time being. That is, they must constantly decide how best to allocate (apportion or distribute) the scarce resources available to them among the various alternative uses to which they can be put. Thus, scarcity is the fundamental condition that gives rise to the patterns of choosing behavior whose study constitutes the main focus of the academic discipline of economics."}], "segments": [{"id": "1058", "clip_id": "47", "clipsegment_id": "78", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "0", "start_seconds": "34", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "4", "end_seconds": "27"}], "source": {"id": "1", "title": "Seinfeld", "slug": "seinfeld", "description": "Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a \u201cshow about nothing.\u201d Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances.
