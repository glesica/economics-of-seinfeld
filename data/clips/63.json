Moral hazard arises because an individual or institution does not take the full consequences and responsibilities of its actions, and therefore, has a tendency to act less carefully than it otherwise would, leaving another party to hold some responsibility for the consequences of those actions. For example, a person with insurance against automobile theft may be less cautious about locking his or her car, because the negative consequences of vehicle theft are (partially) the responsibility of the insurance company."}], "segments": [{"id": "907", "clip_id": "63", "clipsegment_id": "122", "start_hours": "0", "start_minutes": "14", "start_seconds": "15", "end_hours": "0", "end_minutes": "15", "end_seconds": "0"}], "source": {"id": "1", "title": "Seinfeld", "slug": "seinfeld", "description": "Seinfeld ran for nine seasons on NBC and became famous as a \u201cshow about nothing.\u201d Basically, the show allows viewers to follow the antics of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer as they move through their daily lives, often encountering interesting people or dealing with special circumstances.
