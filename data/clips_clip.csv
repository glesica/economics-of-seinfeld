He becomes dissatisfied with high fees at the blood bank, and decides to keep it at home instead.  In the meantime, Jerry nicks his jugular with an Exacto knife and needs blood.

This illustrates that when savers save, their assets don't sit idle;  they are immediately channeled to some productive investment most often by the banking system or another intermediary (such as the blood bank in this example), but sometimes through direct transfer (such is the case with direct purchase of stocks and bonds, and in this example, the direct transfer of Kramer's blood to Jerry).

This illustrates the nominal exchange rate (50,000 yen for a few hundred dollars) and points to the idea of the real exchange rate (in terms of purchasing power, 50,000 yen doesn't purchase many visiting days in Manhattan).
