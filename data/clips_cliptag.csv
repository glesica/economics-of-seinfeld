13,altruism,altruism,Altruism is selfless concern for the welfare of others. Altruism focuses on a motivation to help others or a want to do something good without reward.
52,arbitrage,arbitrage,Arbitrage is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets.
9,asymmetric information,asymmetric-information,Asymmetric information occurs when one party has more or better information than the other. This creates an imbalance of power in transactions that can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry.
41,bads,bads,"In economics, a bad is the opposite of a good. ""Bads"" can be thought of as goods with a negative value to the consumer, or a negative price in the marketplace."
69,bandwagon effect,bandwagon-effect,"The bandwagon effect is the observation that people often do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Without examining the merits of the particular thing, people tend to “follow the crowd.”"
63,barriers to entry,barriers-to-entry,Barriers to entry are conditions or circumstances that make it very difficult or unacceptably costly for outside firms to enter a particular market to compete with the established firm or firms that are already selling the good or service involved. 
55,black market,black-market,"A black market is one in which certain goods or services are routinely traded in a manner contrary to the laws or regulations of the government in power. Typical reasons why the market goes underground in this way include the desire by substantial numbers of buyers and sellers to evade restrictive government price controls or inconvenient rationing schemes, to avoid paying heavy taxes on the good or service in question, or simply to be able to obtain forbidden goods or services that the government does not want the people to have at all."
47,cartel,cartel,A cartel is a group of producers with an agreement to collude in setting prices and output.
59,change in demand,change-in-demand,"A change in demand is a shift in the demand curve. It may be caused by many factors, but not a change in the price of the good. An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right, while a decrease in demand shifts the demand curve to the left."
95,change in supply,change-in-supply,"A change in supply is a shift in the supply curve. It may be caused by many factors, but not a change in the price of the good. An increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right, while a decrease in supply shifts the supply curve to the left."
68,change in technology,change-in-technology,A change in technology implies an improvement in the practical application of knowledge.
35,changes in payoffs,changes-in-payoffs,"In game theory, changes in payoffs imply changes in the motivations of players. Payoffs may represent profit, quantity, ""utility,"" or other continuous measures, or may simply rank the desirability of outcomes. "
26,Coase theorem,coase-theorem,"The Coase theorem states that, when trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs, bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights."
36,collective bargaining,collective-bargaining,Collective bargaining involves negotiations between an employer and labor union representatives concerning an improvement of work conditions or wages.
48,collusion,collusion,"Collusion refers to acts of cooperation or collaboration among rival entities. In economics, collusion takes place within an industry when rival companies cooperate for their mutual benefit."
46,commitment device,commitment-device,A commitment device is a way of changing incentives so as to make otherwise empty threats or promises credible.  
27,common resource,common-resource,"A common resource is a type of good consisting of a natural or human-made resource system, whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining benefits from its use. Unlike pure public goods, common resources face problems of congestion or overuse, because they are rival. Examples of common resources include irrigation systems, fishing grounds, pastures, forests, water or the atmosphere."
101,comparative advantage,comparative-advantage,Comparative advantage is the ability of a producer to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than other producers.
83,compensating differentials,compensating-differentials,"Compensating differentials represent a wage premium for unpleasant aspects of a job. Jobs differ along several dimensions. In equilibrium, labor markets establish wages that tend to make different jobs relatively close substitutes at the margin. "
82,competition,competition_1,"Competition is the allocation of productive resources to their most highly valued uses and encouraging efficiency. Microeconomics theory distinguishes between perfect competition and imperfect competition, concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than perfect competition. Competition, according to economic theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition (monopoly) or little competition (oligopoly)."
42,complements,complements,"Complements are goods that are consumed together. When two goods are complements, a price increase for one product leads to a drop in the demand for the other product."
65,compound interest,compound-interest,"Compound interest involves adding accumulated interest back to the principal, so that interest is earned on interest from that moment on."
85,consumer sovereignty,consumer-sovereignty,"Consumer sovereignty refers to the rule of purchasers in markets as to production of goods. In unrestricted markets, those with income or wealth are able to use their purchasing power to motivate producers as what to produce (and how much). Customers do not necessarily have to buy and, if dissatisfied, can take their business elsewhere, while the profit-seeking sellers find that they can make the greatest profit by trying to provide the best possible products for the price (or the lowest possible price for a given product)."
6,cost-benefit analysis,cost-benefit-analysis,"Cost-benefit analysis involves, whether explicitly or implicitly, weighing the total expected costs against the total expected benefits of one or more actions in order to choose the best or most profitable option. Rational agents are assumed to never take an action for which the expected benefits are less than the expected costs."
50,credible threat,credible-threat,A credible threat is a threat made by a player in a sequential game that would be in the best interest for the player to carry out.
99,deadweight loss of gift-giving,deadweight-loss-of-gift-giving,"The deadweight loss of gift-giving is the loss of efficiency that occurs when the value of the gift to the recipient is less than the cost of the gift to the giver. In this case, economists argue that cash would be a more efficient gift."
20,demand,demand,Demand is the willingness and ability of the people within a market area to purchase a good or service. Economists generally assume there is an inverse relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded by buyers.
17,depreciation of capital,depreciation-of-capital,Depreciation of capital occurs as the value or productivity of an asset declines.
25,diminishing marginal utility,diminishing-marginal-utility,"The principle of diminishing marginal utility says that, as an individual consumes more and more of a good, each successive unit increases her utility, or enjoyment, less and less."
75,diversification,diversification,Diversification means reducing risk by investing in a variety of assets.
80,dominant strategy,dominant-strategy,"In game theory, a dominant strategy is a strategy that is better than another strategy for one player, no matter how that player's opponents may play. "
15,economics of crime,economics-of-crime,"The economics of crime is a field of study that uses economic theory, tools, and concepts (such as cost-benefit analysis, incentives, and rational behavior) to understand the determinants of crime and inform public policy on crime matters."
49,economies of scale,economies-of-scale,Economies of scale is a long-run economic concept and refers to reductions in unit cost as the size of a facility and the usage levels of other inputs increase.
104,efficiency,efficiency,Efficiency occurs when nothing more can be achieved given the resources available.
23,efficient markets,efficient-markets,"The efficient-market hypothesis asserts that financial markets are ""informationally efficient"". In other words, an investor cannot consistently achieve greater than average returns, given the information publicly available at the time the investment is made."
32,entrepreneurship,entrepreneurship,Entrepreneurship is the ability and willingness to combine resources into a productive enterprise.
60,expectations,expectations,"Expectations affect demand in a variety of ways, including expectations of price changes and expectations of changes in income."
11,externality,externality,An externality is a situation in which the private costs or benefits to the producers or purchasers of a good or service differs from the total social costs or benefits entailed in its production and consumption.

74,fallacy of composition,fallacy-of-composition,A fallacy of composition arises when one infers that something is true for all when it is true of some (or even every) part.
39,financial intermediation,financial-intermediation,"Financial intermediation typically facilitates the channeling of funds between lenders and borrowers. That is, savers (lenders) give funds to an intermediary institution (such as a bank), and that institution gives those funds to spenders (borrowers). "
53,fixed costs,fixed-costs,"Fixed costs are business expenses that are not dependent on the level of goods or services produced by the business. They are the costs of fixed inputs, such as rent or insurance."
91,free entry and exit,free-entry-and-exit,"Free entry is a term used by economists to describe a condition in which can sellers freely enter the market for an economic good by establishing production and beginning to sell the product. Along these same lines, free exit occurs when a firm can exit the market without limit when economic losses are being incurred."
70,free rider,free-rider,"A free rider is a person who chooses to receive the benefits of a ""public good "" or a ""positive externality "" without contributing to paying the costs of producing those benefits."
72,functions of markets,functions-of-markets,The functions of markets include providing opportunities for the exchange of goods and services and allocating resources to their highest-valued uses. 
66,future value,future-value,Future value measures how much an amount of money will be worth once compound interest has been added.
87,gains from exchange,gains-from-exchange,Gains from exchange refer to the net benefits to agents from voluntary trading with each other.
8,game theory,game-theory,"Game theory attempts to mathematically capture behavior in strategic situations, or games, in which an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others. Game theory has been used to study a wide variety of human and animal behaviors. It was initially developed in economics to understand a large collection of economic behaviors, including behaviors of firms, markets, and consumers. The use of game theory in the social sciences has expanded, and game theory has been applied to political, sociological, and psychological behaviors as well."
1,imperfect information,imperfect-information,"Imperfect information is a situation in which the parties to a transaction have different information, as when the seller of a used car has more information about its quality than the buyer. Sellers often have better information about a good than buyers because they are more familiar with it. They know more about its quality, durability, and other features. Buyers, in contrast, have limited contact with the commodity and thus have less information.  Another common example of asymmetric information occurs in the labor market. Workers are knowledgeable about their skills, industriousness, and productivity. Employers, in contrast, have limited information about the quality of prospective workers. Another good example is the insurance market. Insurers often have less information about the risks taken by their clients, and in fact, insurance may alter a person's behavior."
31,incentives,incentives,"An incentive is any factor (financial or non-financial) that enables or motivates a particular course of action, or counts as a reason for preferring one choice to the alternatives."
107,inferior good,inferior-good,An inferior good is a good that a person demands less of as income rises.  Standard examples of inferior goods include second-hand furniture and clothing and Spam.

37,labor union,labor-union,A labor union is of a group of workers who have joined together to protect their rights.
57,law of demand,law-of-demand,"The law of demand suggests that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.  Thus, as price falls, individuals consume more and vice versa."
106,luxury goods,luxury-goods,A luxury good is a good for which demand increases more than proportionally as income rises.
92,monopolistic competition,monopolistic-competition,Monopolistic competition is a market with a large number of firms selling similar but differentiated products with no significant barriers to entry.
64,monopoly power,monopoly-power,Monopoly power is the ability of a firm to alter the market price of the good or service it sells.
2,moral hazard,moral-hazard,"Moral hazard occurs when a party insulated from risk behaves differently than it would behave if it were fully exposed to the risk. Moral hazard arises because an individual or institution does not take the full consequences and responsibilities of its actions, and therefore, has a tendency to act less carefully than it otherwise would, leaving another party to hold some responsibility for the consequences of those actions. For example, a person with insurance against automobile theft may be less cautious about locking his or her car, because the negative consequences of vehicle theft are (partially) the responsibility of the insurance company."
96,movement along a demand curve,movement-along-a-demand-curve,A movement along a demand curve is a change in quantity demanded. It is caused by a change in the price of the good. There is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.
97,movement along a supply curve,movement-along-a-supply-curve,A movement along a supply curve is a change in quantity supplied. It is caused by a change in the price of the good. There is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

28,non-excludable goods,non-excludable-goods,A non-excludable good is one for which it is impossible to prevent an individual who does not pay for that thing from enjoying the benefits of it.
109,non-price competition,non-price-competition,"Non-price competition often occurs when prices are regulated. Since a firm cannot compete by offering a more attractive price, it must attract customers in other ways, including gifts."
108,normal good,normal-good,A normal good is a good that a person will purchase more of as income rises. Most goods are normal goods.
61,opportunity cost,opportunity-cost,Opportunity cost is the cost of the next-best alternative. The notion of opportunity cost plays a crucial part in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently. It is important to keep in mind that opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs.
67,present value,present-value,"Present value is the value on a given date of a future payment or series of future payments, discounted to reflect the time value of money."
103,price ceiling,price-ceiling,"A price ceiling is a government-imposed limit on the price charged for a product. If the price ceiling is set below the market equilibrium price, a shortage will occur. This leads to a rationing problem."
93,product differentiation,product-differentiation,"Product differentiation is the process of distinguishing the differences of a product or offering from others, to make it more attractive to a particular target market. This may involve product characteristics, services, or location."
29,property rights,property-rights,Property rights entail the exclusive authority to determine how and by whom a particular resource is used.
71,public good,public-good,A public good is a good that is non-excludable and not rival in consumption.
98,randomized strategies,randomized-strategies,A randomized strategy introduces a chance element into the decision-making process that is designed to confound the information content of the decision-maker's observed choices.
86,rate of time preference,rate-of-time-preference,The rate of time preference pertains to how large a premium a consumer places on enjoyment nearer in time over more remote enjoyment.
94,rationality,rationality,A rational individual will always choose actions for which the expected benefits are at least as large as the expected costs. Economists generally assume that individuals are rational.
102,rationing mechanisms,rationing-mechanisms,"A rationing mechanism is a system for choosing who gets how many goods during a shortage. Long lines are often used to ration goods in shortage (so the good is distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis). In addition, black markets often develop as a way of rationing goods that are in shortage."
45,real exchange rate,real-exchange-rate,The real exchange rate refers to the purchasing power of two currencies relative to one another.
110,regulated prices,regulated-prices,Regulation involves controlling human or societal behavior by rules or restrictions.

30,rival goods,rival-goods,Rival goods are goods whose consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers.
40,saving,saving,"Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. Methods of saving include putting money aside in a bank, cookie jar, or a pension plan."
62,scarcity,scarcity,"Scarcity is a condition where there is less of something available than at least some people would like to have if they could have them at no cost to themselves. Because the total quantity of goods and services that people would like to have always far exceeds the amount which available economic resources are capable of producing in all known human societies, people must constantly make choices about which desires to satisfy first and which to leave less than fully satisfied for the time being. That is, they must constantly decide how best to allocate (apportion or distribute) the scarce resources available to them among the various alternative uses to which they can be put. Thus, scarcity is the fundamental condition that gives rise to the patterns of choosing behavior whose study constitutes the main focus of the academic discipline of economics."
10,signaling,signaling,"Signaling is the idea that one party (termed the “agent”) credibly conveys some information about itself to another party (the “principal”). For example, in job-market signaling, (potential) employees send a signal about their ability level to the employer by acquiring certain education credentials. The informational value of the credential comes from the fact that the employer assumes it is positively correlated with having greater ability."
51,strategic move,strategic-move,A strategic move is an action taken by a player outside the defined actions of the game in order to gain a strategic advantage and increase one's payoff.
21,substitutes,substitutes,"Two goods are substitutes if, when the market price of the first good rises, the demand for the second good also rises."
38,sunk cost,sunk-cost,Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and which cannot be recovered. They should not be considered when making decisions.
90,supply of labor,supply-of-labor,Labor supply  is the willingness and ability of the people within a market area to provide labor services. 
7,thinking at the margin,thinking-at-the-margin,"From an economist's perspective, making choices involves thinking 'at the margin' - that is, making decisions based on small changes in resources. Doing so leads to the optimal decisions being made, subject to preferences, resources and informational constraints."
34,trade-off,trade-off,A trade-off refers to giving up one thing in return for something else. It implies a decision to be made with both an upside and downside of a particular choice.
22,unemployment,unemployment,"Unemployment occurs when an individual is not working and is actively seeking employment. There are three types of unemployment identified by economists: frictional, structural, and cyclical."
12,unintended consequences,unintended-consequences,"Unintended consequences are situations where an action results in an outcome that is not (or not only) what is intended. The unintended results may be foreseen or unforeseen, but they are logical or likely results of the action. Unintended consequences may be the result of policies that are not well thought out."
88,unlimited wants,unlimited-wants,"Unlimited wants essentially mean that people never get enough, that there is always something else that they would like to have. When combined with limited resources, unlimited wants result in the fundamental problem of scarcity."
14,utility,utility,"Utility is an economic concept referring to the precise degree of personal satisfaction, pleasure, or sense of want-fulfillment an individual derives from consuming some quantity of a good or service at a particular point in time."
24,value of information,value-of-information,The value of information is the amount a decision maker would be willing to pay for information prior to making a decision.

58,willingness to sell,willingness-to-sell,A seller’s willingness to sell can be measured by the minimum price the seller will accept for some good or service.
73,zero-sum game,zero-sum-game,"A zero-sum game describes a situation in which a participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participant(s). If the total gains of the participants are added up, and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. "
111,dual-self models,dual-self-models,"Dual-self models describe behavior as a struggle between ""cognitive"" and ""impulsive"" areas in the brain. Evidence of dual-self models with a short-run, impulsive self and a rational, higher-cognitive self have been found in several behavioral experiments."
112,time inconsistency,time-inconsistency,Time inconsistency describes a situation where a decision-maker's preferences change over time in such a way that what is preferred at one point in time is inconsistent with what is preferred at another point in time.
