Because the total quantity of goods and services that people would like to have always far exceeds the amount which available economic resources are capable of producing in all known human societies, people must constantly make choices about which desires to satisfy first and which to leave less than fully satisfied for the time being. That is, they must constantly decide how best to allocate (apportion or distribute) the scarce resources available to them among the various alternative uses to which they can be put. Thus, scarcity is the fundamental condition that gives rise to the patterns of choosing behavior whose study constitutes the main focus of the academic discipline of economics."}, {"id": "753", "object_id": "55", "content_type_id": "18", "tag_id": "73", "name": "zero-sum game", "slug": "zero-sum-game", "description": "A zero-sum game describes a situation in which a participant's gain or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other participant(s).
