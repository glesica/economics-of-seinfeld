It is the simplicity of Seinfeld that makes it so appropriate for use in economics courses. Using these clips (as well as clips from other television shows or movies) makes economic concepts come alive, making them more real for students. Ultimately, students will start seeing economics everywhere \u2013 in other TV shows, in popular music, and most importantly, in their own lives.", "source_type": "t"}, "contributor": {}}]}
